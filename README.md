# Embedded System Programming

This course is focused on giving you real world coding experience and hands on project work with ARM based Microcontrollers (STM32).
In Introduction to Embedded System Programming, you'll learn the essential skills for reading and writing I/O lines, 
configuring peripherals such as analog and digital converters, counter/timer modules, and the serial interface or UART. First,
you'll discover how to configure the clock system of the Microcontroller to balance performance and power consumption.
Later, you'll explore digital and analog inputs and outputs, and write interrupt service routines to handle real-time tasks quickly.
Finally, you'll delve into the basics of powerful debugging tools by putting the Microcontroller to sleep to extend the battery life of the system, 
and ultimately learn to refactor and organize your code.By the end of this course, you'll have the fundamental skills necessary for embedded firmware 
development, helping you design and build products of your own.
